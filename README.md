# telml

This is the repository for both the `telml` and the `telml-markup`
packages. The former implements a TeX-inspired data format, while
the latter uses that data format to implement a lightweight,
extensible markup format.

This repository contains a
[cabal.project file](http://blog.ezyang.com/2016/05/announcing-cabal-new-build-nix-style-local-builds/), which facilitates building multiple packages together;
this repository had previously been used for just the `telml` package,
and the corresponding
[`telml-markup`](https://github.com/aisamanra/telml-markup)
repository is left but will not be updated.
